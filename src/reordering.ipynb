    "Let G be a graph (V, E) with n = |V| nodes and m = |E| edges. We can say that G is a very large graph (LVG) if n and m are at least some millions. Also, G is a sparse graph if m = O(n). In this analysis, I used inet and ip graphs downloaded on Clémence Magnien's website (https://www-complexnetworks.lip6.fr/~magnien/Diameter/). For all my tests, I used a desktop with i7-9700K, 16Go RAM 2666MHz & CL16 and a SDD for writing edges list files.\n",
    "\n",
    "For two isomorphic graphs G and G’, any polynomial algorithm on graphs should take the same amount of time. But, when it comes to very large graph with millions or billions of edges, this is not true since two ismorphic graph can be ordered differently on the ram. Therefore, CPU will take slightly more time for an unordered graph traversal since he has to access further memory region.\n",

Initilizer will create an empty adjacency dictionnary and add every edges in it. An empty adjacency dictionnary with community key will also be created and thus for sorting optimization in the reorder() method.\n",
    "The method reorder() reorder the graph sorting vertices by community size and vertex degree.\n",
    "The method saveReorderAs() take filename in parametter and save the reordered graph in ./graphs/filename. This method take a lot of time but can be improved with threading depending on the graph file. Since the longest part is the traversal of graph and the creation of the string to be writed, thread can help but they have to keep the order.\n",
